# ðŸŒ± Climate Analysis of Ecuador: COâ‚‚ and Temperature Trends
This project explores long-term climate behavior in Ecuador and the world using Python. It focuses on atmospheric COâ‚‚ concentrations and annual surface temperature changes from 1961 to 2022.

The analysis includes:

- Statistical summaries and distribution modeling.

- Seasonal decomposition and anomaly detection.

- Moving averages and regression trend analysis.

- Decadal comparisons of temperature variability.

- Linear regressions linking COâ‚‚ levels to temperature change.

By combining visual analytics with statistical rigor, the project offers a clear, data-driven narrative of Ecuadorâ€™s evolving climate. Tools used include Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy.
